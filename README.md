# WEB102 Prework - *Name of App Here*

Submitted by: **Your Name Here**

**Name of your app** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
      - I would add links to another cite for each game.
      - I would make the Stats section contain accessible buttons because they look they would be maybe also links to another cite.
      - finally maybe just a little more css work make it look nice.
